# BlurHash

## Blurhash Image Place Holder

In short, BlurHash takes an image, and gives you a short string (only 20-30 characters!) that represents the placeholder for this image. You do this on the backend of your service, and store the string along with the image in firebase.It takes the string, and decodes it into an image that it shows while the real image is loading over the network.
